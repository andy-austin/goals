2. Form Navigation Buttons Partially Hidden

Location: Form steps (visible in screenshots)

- The "Atrás" (Back) button is partially cut off at the bottom of the viewport on several form steps
- This may be due to viewport height or fixed positioning issues

3. Timeline Marker View - Limited Visibility

Location: Timeline marker section

- On mobile, only 1-2 goal markers are visible at a time in the marker view due to the compressed horizontal space
- Consider making this section horizontally scrollable with touch gestures more prominent

4. Gantt Chart Tooltip Overlap

Location: Gantt chart section

- When hovering/tapping on Gantt bars, the tooltip can overlap with other elements
- The "New Car Fund" tooltip was overlapping with other goal rows

5. Minor: Page Title Scrolls Out of View

Location: Form wizard steps

- When scrolling through longer form steps, the page title "Crear un nuevo objetivo" scrolls off-screen
- Consider a sticky header or compact progress indicator
