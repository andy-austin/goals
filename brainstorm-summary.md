## Top 5 Recommendations

### 🥇 1. LLM Cost Tracker
**The AI wave play**

- **Problem:** Teams don't know how much they spend on OpenAI/Anthropic
- **Solution:** Proxy API calls, track usage per user/project, set budgets
- **Price:** $19-49/month
- **Build time:** 3-4 weeks
- **Why now:** Every company experimenting with AI, costs exploding
- **Competition:** Low (new problem)
- **Stack:** Python backend + Next.js frontend

---

### 🥈 2. Kubernetes Cost Monitor
**The B2B infrastructure play**

- **Problem:** K8s clusters waste money (over-provisioned pods, zombie deployments)
- **Solution:** Scan cluster, show waste, recommend right-sizing
- **Price:** $29-99/month
- **Build time:** 4-6 weeks
- **Your edge:** You know K8s, most devs don't
- **Competition:** Kubecost (expensive), CAST AI (complex)
- **ROI pitch:** "Save $X/month on your cluster"

---

### 🥉 3. USD Income Tracker for LATAM Remote Workers
**The niche play**

- **Problem:** Remote workers earn USD, pay taxes locally, need exchange rate tracking
- **Solution:** Log USD income, auto-convert, track for taxes
- **Price:** $9/month
- **Build time:** 3-4 weeks
- **Your edge:** You live in Uruguay, you ARE the target user
- **Competition:** Very low (no one building for LATAM specifically)
- **Countries:** Argentina, Uruguay, Colombia, Mexico, Brazil

---

### 4. Uptime + Status Page Combo
**The recurring revenue play**

- **Problem:** Need both monitoring AND status page (usually separate tools)
- **Solution:** One tool that monitors + auto-updates public status page
- **Price:** $15-29/month
- **Build time:** 4-5 weeks
- **Why it works:** Every SaaS needs this, low churn
- **Differentiation:** Simplicity, 2-in-1 value

---

### 5. Cron/Background Job Dashboard
**The Python niche play**

- **Problem:** Celery/RQ/APScheduler jobs fail silently
- **Solution:** Dashboard showing all jobs, history, failures, alerts
- **Price:** $9-29/month
- **Build time:** 4-5 weeks
- **Your edge:** Python niche = less competition
- **Stack:** Python backend + Next.js frontend
